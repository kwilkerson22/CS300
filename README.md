Data Structures and Algorithms


What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course I was tasked with creating a program for ABC University to help their computer science advisors access course information to assist their students. I used my knowledge of data structures and algorithms to help me complete two projects. First, was to create a pseudocode document. The second project was to write the code for the application. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
It was important for me to decompose the problem into smaller steps so that I could develop a plan of action for how to tackle both projects. One important aspect of my planning was to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each data structure and decide which one worked best based on the program requirements. I also kept in mind the runtime and memory complexity of each structure so that my application could run as efficiently as possible. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? 
There were several strategies to I used to keep my projects moving forward when I encountered roadblocks. First, I looked for tutorials that addressed the problems I would encounter. I would also review my own documentation in my code to make sure that I was doing what I intended to do. I would also take breaks when needed so that I could return to my projects with a fresh mind. I had the flexibility to do this because I developed a schedule and set small goals that I wanted to achieve. Progressively chipping away at the problem helped me significantly.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I feel that I have new tools available with my knowledge of data structures and algorithms which can help me be a better problem solver in the design and development process. I have also become more efficient as a developer because my goal is to eliminate unnecessary lines of code while still achieving my overall objectives. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I think that I have continued to write clear documentation and follow industry standards to make sure that my programs are readable. I also have focused on making my programs more modular and scalable which make my programs more flexible in meeting the user's requirements. My projects were written in a way that I could change the data structure used without having to change the entirety of my project.
